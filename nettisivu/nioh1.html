        <p><span>nioh is a mission based game where each mission has an unique type of objective</span></p>
        <p><span>most main mission are about just killing a boss but they're alot longer in terms of just map design and going through <br> but they also have a "sub objective" if you want to gather all the kodama</span></p>
        <p><span>the game is harder than most would think with it's fast paced combat and high damaging opponents <br> but if you pay attention to what the enemies are going to do then you  shouldn't have too many problems</span></p>
        <p><span>the games online is made super well due to it being seamless <br> meaning you don't have to do a certain mission twice because if you complete it in co-op then it'll be done for the both of you <br> the game also has a PVP game where you pick a certain type of PVP and then fight against another player in a matchmaking you can choose the type of <br> build with certain stats and items or you can use your own items and weapons</span></p>
        <p><span>there are different weapon types that are completely different from each other as example the "kusarigama" is a fast paced scythe attached to a chain that you swing around <br> and an "odachi" which is a heavy type katana looking weapon although this weapon you get from the DLCs but if you buy the game on the PC you usually only get the Complete Edition which has all the DLCs by default so you don't have to buy them seperately</span></p>
