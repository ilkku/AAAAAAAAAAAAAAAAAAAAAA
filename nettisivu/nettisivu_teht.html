    <p><span>reason 1: this mf</span></p>
    <img class="cat" src="download (1).jpg"> <br>
    <p><span>reason 2: splitstaff is a weapon in it</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 3: you can make cool armors such as this</span></p>
    <img class="cat" src="lel.jpg"> <br>
    <p><span>reason 4: the music is magnificent</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 5: there aren't many unnecessary gank bosses</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 6: the story is honestly very good and it's pretty interesting to follow through</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 7: the graphics are quite underrated</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 8: the fighting is super complex but not too hard to figure out how to do</span></p>
    <p><span>reason 9: the game is harder than most but it's hard in a fair way</span></p>
    <p><span>and finally reason 10: it's honestly super fun</span></p>
    <p><span>the game has an online co-op that holds up to three players total and <br> technically an online clan war system where you have to get a certain currency called "glory" and the "clan" that has the most after the war is over wins more glory</span></p>
    <p><span>honorable mentions: you don't have to pay 40€ extra for the DLCs because if you buy it from steam, epic games or someplace else it should be the "complete" edition if it's on PC</span></p> <br>
    <h3><span>slight sneak peak to the game</span></h3>
    <p2 class="p2"><span>your characters is named hide he/she (you can change the gender so its hard to discern.) wakes up in a house to the noice of a soldier banging on their door asking for you to save them. you help the soldier and such is the first missions start
        you then have to go around the map clearing it as you go killing enemies, looting items and if you look for them enough you might find yourself a few of these things called kodamas and a cute round cat called a scampuss 
        (dont worry if you bought the game just for them they aren't that hard to find if you just check behind houses and below boxes inside houses) the point of the mission based is to just go around if you want to or just run to the boss only doing the required thing to proceed.
        usually there is only one boss in each mission but there is a few missions with two or more bosses but they usually aren't at the same time.</span></p2>
    <p><span>games overall rating would be 10/10 would recommend (own opinion)</span></p>
    <h2><span>my opinions on the DLC's</h2>
    <p><span>The story of Tengu's Disciple is: A great battle has taken place at Yashima in the late Heian period. As a visitor in Yashima, our protagonist finds a shrine possessing a mysterious whistle called the Sohayamaru. Upon inspection, the whistle shines radiantly as the shadow of Yokai can be seen lurking in the background. It is revealed that whenever wars take place, heroes wielding the Sohayamaru will head into battle in order to restore peace back into this land.</span></p> <br>
    <p><span>The story of Darkness in the Capital is: In order to unravel the mysteries surrounding the history of the Sohayamaru, our protagonist ventures to Kyoto City and discovers a shrine furnished with an old worn-out box. Upon inspection, the Sohayamaru once again shines brilliantly and the protagonist is whisked away to the middle of the Heian Period, landing in an ancient version of the capital. 
        Contrary to its name “Heian Palace,” which means peace and tranquility, ancient Kyoto was terrorized by countless Yokai during this time period. However, there existed many heroes who were brave enough to oppose these demons. Among them were the most preeminent demon slayer and the strongest sorcerer in history, along with their subordinates and colleagues fighting at their side. 
        Our protagonist joins forces with these famous heroes in order to quell the unrest and destruction caused by the Yokai hordes, while learning more about the connections between an even more distant past and the present time period from which they came.</span></p> <br>
    <p><span>The story of The First Samurai is: The First Samurai brings the protagonist to the Suzuka Pass during the beginning of the Heian Period. In the climactic 3rd expansion of the Nioh 2 saga, the protagonist will once again confront their arch-nemesis, Otakemaru.</span></p>
